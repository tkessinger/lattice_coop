  volume = {521},
  issn = {0378-4371},
  abstract = {Cooperation is omnipresent in the evolution of social species. In human societies, people voluntarily associate and cooperate with each other to exchange payments, which results in the inclusion of transaction costs during the process. This paper applies transaction costs to the spatial prisoner's dilemma game to better understand the evolution of cooperation by introducing an active\textendash{}passive mechanism. In particular, a player who actively proposes the game should pay a transaction costs, while the passive responder pays nothing. Using Monte Carlo simulations and pair-approximation analysis, we investigate the frequency of cooperators in the stationary state for different values of the transaction cost, which maintain the same trend. It is found that there exists an optimal value of the transaction cost at which cooperation is optimally promoted. For small or large values of the transaction cost, the promotive effect decreases, and the evolution of cooperation may be impaired if compared to the absence of the active\textendash{}passive mechanism. Finally, we explain the emergence of large clusters and theoretically confirm the existence of the optimal transaction cost. The mechanism of transaction costs enhancing cooperation resembles a resonance-like phenomenon, which may be helpful in understanding the cooperative behavior induced by the different behaviors between individuals in society.},

  volume = {243},
  issn = {0022-5193},
  abstract = {We study evolutionary games on graphs. Each player is represented by a vertex of the graph. The edges denote who meets whom. A player can use any one of n strategies. Players obtain a payoff from interaction with all their immediate neighbors. We consider three different update rules, called `birth\textendash{}death', `death\textendash{}birth' and `imitation'. A fourth update rule, `pairwise comparison', is shown to be equivalent to birth\textendash{}death updating in our model. We use pair approximation to describe the evolutionary game dynamics on regular graphs of degree k. In the limit of weak selection, we can derive a differential equation which describes how the average frequency of each strategy on the graph changes over time. Remarkably, this equation is a replicator equation with a transformed payoff matrix. Therefore, moving a game from a well-mixed population (the complete graph) onto a regular graph simply results in a transformation of the payoff matrix. The new payoff matrix is the sum of the original payoff matrix plus another matrix, which describes the local competition of strategies. We discuss the application of our theory to four particular examples, the Prisoner's Dilemma, the Snow-Drift game, a coordination game and the Rock\textendash{}Scissors\textendash{}Paper game.},

  abstract = {Game theory is one of the key paradigms behind many scientific disciplines from biology to behavioral sciences to economics. In its evolutionary form and especially when the interacting agents are linked in a specific social network the underlying solution concepts and methods are very similar to those applied in non-equilibrium statistical physics. This review gives a tutorial-type overview of the field for physicists. The first four sections introduce the necessary background in classical and evolutionary game theory from the basic definitions to the most important results. The fifth section surveys the topological complications implied by non-mean-field-type social network structures in general. The next three sections discuss in detail the dynamic behavior of three prominent classes of models: the Prisoner's Dilemma, the Rock\textendash{}Scissors\textendash{}Paper game, and Competing Associations. The major theme of the review is in what sense and how the graph structure of interactions can modify and enrich the picture of long term behavioral patterns emerging in evolutionary games.},

  volume = {8},
  issn = {1367-2630},
  abstract = {Stochasticity has recently emerged as being a potent promoter of cooperative behaviour in systems developed under the framework of evolutionary game theory. In the spatial prisoner's dilemma game, the fitness of players adopting the cooperative strategy was found to be resonantly dependent on the intensity of payoff fluctuations. Evidently, the phenomenon resembles classical coherence resonance, whereby the noise-induced order, or coherence, of the dynamics is substituted with the noise-induced prevalence of the `good' strategy, thus marking a constructive effect of noise on the system. The connection between the former `dynamical' coherence resonance and the latter so-called `evolutionary' coherence resonance, however, has not yet been established. The two different definitions of coherence resonance appear to provoke some discomfort. The goal of the present paper is therefore, on one hand, to draw a clear line between the two different perceptions of coherence resonance, and on the other, to show that the two apparently disjoint phenomena, that are currently related only by name, can in fact be observed simultaneously, sharing an identical mechanism of emergence.},
